# Domino JNA for Java 11

This is a fork of Karsten Lehmann brilliant Java-library "Domino JNA":

https://github.com/klehmann/domino-jna


I've using this library in my company for quite a while in a data processing pipeline. I've "ported" the library to Java 11 (Mainly by providing Glassfish CORBA which is needed for Java 11).
I also cleaned up the code (I only forked the directory "domino-jna") a little bit and ported it from Maven to Gradle.
