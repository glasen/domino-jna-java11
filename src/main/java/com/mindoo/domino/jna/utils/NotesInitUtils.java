	 * This routine initializes the Notes runtime system for all environments.<br>

	 * This routine can also be used for standalone programs running with Domino.<br>
	 * <br>
	 * After completing all C API actions and before the program exits, call {@link #notesTerm()}.<br>
	 * <br>
	 * NotesInitExtended uses argv[0] to attempt to locate the Domino or Notes executable directory.<br>
	 * If the Domino or Notes executable directory is not in argv[0], then NotesInitExtended will
	 * use the path to determine the Domino or Notes executable directory.
	 * Then it performs the same initialization that NotesInit() performs.<br>
	 * <br>
	 * As of release 5 of Domino and Notes, you can specify an ini file to NotesInitExtended,
	 * by passing an argument preceded by an "=" sign. This argument can be any argument
	 * except the first argument.<br>
	 * <br>
	 * The name of the ini file may include the full path specification.<br>
	 * <br>
	 * If the path is not included then the specified ini file must reside in the Domino or Notes
	 * executable directory.<br>
	 * <br>
	 * Use the following syntax followed by the file name in the argv list: example "=new.ini".<br>
	 * <br>
	 * Applications may use more than one thread of execution accessing Domino or Notes.<br>
	 * <br>
	 * Each new thread created by an application must call {@link #notesInitThread()} before
	 * making calls to Domino or Notes and {@link #notesTermThread()} before the thread terminates.<br>
	 * <br>
	 * Please refer to the reference entries for these functions for more information.<br>
